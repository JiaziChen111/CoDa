Description: Implementation of the Compositional-Data Lee-Carter Mortality Model (CoDa). 
  This is a Lee-Carter (1992) <doi:10.2307/2290201> type method that can be used 
  to modelling and forecasting the life table distribution of deaths (dx) using 
  Principal Component Analysis. In the context of mortality forecasting the CoDa 
  method was fist used in Bergeron-Boucher et al. (2017) <10.4054/DemRes.2017.37.17>.
  The package includes functions for fitting the model, analysing it's 
  goodness-of-fit and performing mortality projections.
